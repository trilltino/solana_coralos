# solana_coralOS — Agent Economy Starter

> A seller **agent** lists a service; buyers — **agent or human** — request it over **CoralOS**, pay
> in **SOL** on-chain, and the seller verifies the payment and delivers. One protocol, one seller,
> **two front doors.**

Every payment is a real on-chain **devnet** transaction. CoralOS (coral-server) coordinates the
agents as a pure MCP message bus — it runs **stock and wallet-free**, because payments settle
agent-side in SOL.

- **Autonomous** front door — an LLM buyer agent requests, decides, and pays another agent.
- **Checkout** front door — a human connects Phantom and pays the same seller, one click.

Both run through the same seller agent over CoralOS. Proven live on devnet (gates G1–G3, see
[`.claude/AGENT_ECONOMY_RESTRUCTURE.md`](.claude/AGENT_ECONOMY_RESTRUCTURE.md)).

## How it works (in plain terms)

New to this? A few building blocks, defined:

- **Agent economy** — software agents (and humans) that buy and sell services from each other and
  **settle payment automatically** — no invoices, no manual approval. Here a *seller* agent offers a
  service (a price quote, an AI completion…); a *buyer* pays per request.

- **CoralOS (`coral-server`)** — the **coordination layer**. Agents join a *session*, open *threads*,
  and talk over **MCP** (Model Context Protocol). Think "switchboard + chat room" for agents. It does
  **not** move money — it only carries the conversation. (We run it stock and wallet-free.)

- **Solana Pay + HTTP 402** — the **payment protocol**. When a buyer asks for a service, the seller
  replies `402 Payment Required` with a `solana:` URL (the Solana Pay format) — who to pay, how much.
  The buyer pays that on-chain and sends the transaction signature back as proof.

- **On-chain settlement, on devnet** — every payment is a **real Solana transaction** you can open in
  a block explorer. It runs on **devnet**, a free test network: play money, identical mechanics to
  mainnet.

- **The two front doors** — the *buyer* can be an **agent** (the autonomous loop — an LLM decides to
  pay) or a **human** (checkout — you click Pay in Phantom). Same seller, same protocol, two ways in.

- **`user-proxy` + the Puppet API** — a human isn't an MCP agent, so to bring them into a coral
  session the kit uses a stand-in agent (`user-proxy`) that the **bridge** drives via coral's Puppet
  API. That's how "human → agent" works under the hood.

The [payment cycle diagram](#how-the-payment-cycle-works) below traces one full request → pay →
deliver in concrete terms.

## 🔑 Keys & accounts you need

Everything is **devnet** and **free**. You bring your own keys in a local `.env` — none are in the
repo. `scripts/setup.js` generates the Solana wallets for you, so you mostly just fund them.

### Required

| What | For | How to get it |
|------|-----|---------------|
| **Devnet SOL** (2 wallets) | paying + receiving | `node scripts/setup.js` generates a buyer + seller keypair into `.env` and prints two addresses. **Fund both** at [faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com) — sign in with GitHub (the web faucet is the only way; CLI/RPC airdrops are gated). |
| **Anthropic API key** | the LLM buyer *decides* to pay (+ the seller's optional `inference` service) | Free-tier key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. *(The on-chain payment works without it — this is only the agent's reasoning step.)* |
| **Phantom wallet** | the human Checkout door | [phantom.com](https://phantom.com) extension, set to **Devnet**. |
| **Docker Desktop** | coral-server launches the agents | [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). *(Skip it with the no-Docker quickstart below.)* |

### Optional (free fallbacks)

| Key | For | Get it |
|-----|-----|--------|
| `HELIUS_API_KEY` | faster devnet RPC | [helius.dev](https://helius.dev) — falls back to public devnet |
| `JUPITER_API_KEY` | higher rate limits | [jup.ag/developers](https://jup.ag/developers) |
| `NEWS_API_KEY` | only `SERVICE=news` | [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) |

> in `coral-agents/buyer-agent/src/llm_buyer.ts` or open an issue.

## Quick start

**One shot** (needs [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) + Docker):

```sh
just dev          # wallets + build images + start coral & bridge
# then fund the 2 printed wallets (see below), open http://localhost:3010, click "Run"
```

`just dev` chains the steps below; `just --list` shows all recipes (`auto`, `logs`, `down`). If a
recipe errors or you don't have `just`, run the steps manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/trilltino/solana_coralOS
cd solana_coralOS

cd scripts && npm install && cd ..
node scripts/setup.js                  # generates wallets → .env, prints 2 addresses

# FUND both printed addresses — the only way is the web faucet (sign in with GitHub):
#   https://faucet.solana.com
# (then add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-… to .env — optional)

bash build-agents.sh                   # build the agent images coral-server launches
docker compose up -d coral bridge      # stock coral-server + the checkout bridge (:3010)
```

Then pick a front door — full guide in [`examples/agent-economy/`](examples/agent-economy/README.md):

```sh
# Autonomous (agent → agent)
cd examples/agent-economy/autonomous && npm install && npm start
docker logs -f buyer-agent             # watch it pay + receive

# Checkout (human → agent)
docker compose up -d bridge            # then open http://localhost:3010 with Phantom (Devnet)
```

**Verify your setup** — one command checks Docker, Node, funded wallets, the stack, and runs a live
payment end-to-end:

```sh
just doctor          # or: node scripts/doctor.js  — green = ready to build
```

Hit a snag? [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) covers the common ones (Docker, faucet
rate-limits, Windows `just`, ports).

**No Docker?** [`examples/agent-economy/quickstart/`](examples/agent-economy/quickstart/README.md)
is the same pay-per-call loop as two bare-metal Node processes over plain HTTP `402`.

## Repo layout

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `examples/agent-economy/` | **the track** — `autonomous/` (agent→agent), `bridge/` (order API + serves the UI), `web/` (the React demo UI), `config/`, `quickstart/` (no-Docker) |
| `coral-agents/` | the agents coral-server launches: `seller-agent` (fork `service.ts`), `buyer-agent`, `user-proxy`, `echo-agent` |
| `packages/agent-runtime/` | agent runtime: `AgentManager`, `Strategy`, MessageBus, CoralOS MCP client, strategies |
| `scripts/` | `setup.js` (wallet generation) + smoke tests |
| `docker-compose.yml` | coral-server + bridge |

## How the payment cycle works

One request, start to finish. Every line is a real message over a CoralOS thread (or HTTP, in the
no-Docker quickstart); the payment in the middle is a real devnet transaction:

```
buyer (agent or human) → "request <query>"           → seller
seller → "PAYMENT_REQUIRED memo=… amount=… url=solana:…"
buyer  → pays the URL on devnet (keypair, or Phantom) → sig
buyer  → "paid <sig> memo=…"                          → seller
seller → getTransaction(sig): verifies recipient + amount on-chain
seller → "DELIVERED <data>"
```

All verification is on-chain. No off-chain trust.

> **CoralOS note:** coral-server is used here purely as the MCP coordination layer. Its *native*
> payment rail (x402/CORAL token) is **not** used — it's half-built upstream — so the kit settles in
> plain SOL, which works end-to-end. Details in `.claude/AGENT_ECONOMY_RESTRUCTURE.md`.

## Optional: Claude Code skills

Two skill sets make building on this kit easier — see [SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md) for the full guide.

**Solana dev skill** (Solana SDK, Anchor, testing, payments) — install via the `skills` CLI:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-dev-skill --global --yes
```

**Coral Protocol skills** (drive coral-server sessions from Claude Code) — run these *inside Claude
Code* as slash commands:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-skill-set
/plugin install coral-skills@coral-skill-set
/reload-plugins
```

Use the full **HTTPS URL** (the `owner/repo` shorthand clones via SSH and fails without GitHub SSH
keys). Then `/coral-setup`, `/coral-session-control`, etc. Reload Claude Code after installing.

## Building on it

The fork points: `coral-agents/seller-agent/src/service.ts → deliverService()` (what's sold),
`coral-agents/buyer-agent/` (what the buyer wants), a new agent in `config/coral.toml`, or
`examples/agent-economy/escrow/` (trustless settlement). Deep guides:

- **[docs/HACKATHON.md](docs/HACKATHON.md)** — composing a hackathon: where to build + what types of apps
- **[docs/APIS.md](docs/APIS.md)** — APIs you can sell (free?/key?/devnet?), incl. the Codex/OpenAI option
- **[docs/REACT_FRONTEND.md](docs/REACT_FRONTEND.md)** — build a full Vite + React + wallet-adapter UI e2e (every file)
- **[docs/EXPANDING_FRONTEND.md](docs/EXPANDING_FRONTEND.md)** — extend the React app: new services, tabs, widgets, theming
- **[docs/SWARM.md](docs/SWARM.md)** — build a multi-agent swarm (broker pattern) — money flowing through a graph
